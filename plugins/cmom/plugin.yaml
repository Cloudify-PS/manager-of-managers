  # The Manager of Managers plugin is responsible for installing and
  # otherwise handling of Cloudify Managers and HA Clusters

  # The 2 definitions (manager and cluster) differ in their execution context:
  # the manager plugin is executed on the Tier 1 manager, while the cluster
  # plugin is executed on the Tier 2 manager (for operations like creating the
  # cluster and uploading resources to the cluster)

  # The third definition (misc) runs on the same executor as `cluster`, but
  # performs other (miscellaneous) functions, os opposed to directly
  # working with the cluster
