inputs:
  plugins:
    description: >
      A list of plugins to upload to the manager after its installation.
      The format should be as follows:
      - wagon: <WAGON_1>
        yaml: <YAML_1>
        tenant: <TENANT_1>
      - wagon: <WAGON_2>
        yaml: <YAML_2>
        visibility: <VIS_2>
      Where:
        * WAGON is either a URL of a Cloudify Plugin (e.g.
          http://repository.cloudifysource.org/cloudify/wagons/cloudify-openstack-plugin/2.0.1/cloudify_openstack_plugin-2.0.1-py27-none-linux_x86_64-centos-Core.wgn),
          or a local (relative to the master manager) path to such wagon (required)
        * YAML is the plugin's plugin.yaml file - again, either URL or local
          path (required)
        * TENANT is the tenant to which the plugin will be uploaded (will be
          created if it doesn't exist already). (Optional - default is
          default_tenant)
        * VISIBILITY defines who can see the plugin - must be one of
          [private, tenant, global] (Optional - default is tenant).
      Both WAGON and YAML are *required* fields
    default: []

  secrets:
    description: >
      A list of secrets to set on the manager after its installation.
      The format should be as follows:
      - key: <KEY_1>
        string: <STRING_1>
        file: <FILE_1>
        visibility: <VISIBILITY_1>
      Where:
        * KEY is the name of the secret which will then be used by other
          blueprints by the intrinsic `get_secret` function (required)
        * STRING is the string value of the secret [mutually exclusive with FILE]
        * FILE is a local path to a file which contents should be used as the
          secrets value [mutually exclusive with VALUE]
        * TENANT is the tenant to which the secret will be uploaded (will be
          created if it doesn't exist already). (Optional - default is
          default_tenant)
        * VISIBILITY defines who can see the secret - must be one of
          [private, tenant, global] (Optional - default is tenant).
      KEY is a *required* field, as well as one (and only one) of STRING or FILE.
